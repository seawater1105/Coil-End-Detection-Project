# Coil-End-Detection-Project
This project detects the end of a coil in moving video. RGB images are converted to grayscale, and a threshold is applied to locate the coil's end. By analyzing pixel brightness in multiple Regions of Interest (ROI), the system tracks and detects the coilâ€™s end in real-time using MATLAB for the image processing algorithm.
